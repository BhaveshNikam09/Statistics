## Statistics Practice
     This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks created for practicing and revising key statistical concepts. These notebooks include theoretical explanations and Python code examples to help understand various statistical methods and their applications.

### Contents
#### 1. Probability Distributions
#### Discrete Distributions (Probability Mass Functions - PMFs):
      1..Uniform Distribution
      2..Bernoulli Distribution
      3..Binomial Distribution
      4.Poisson Distribution

#### Continuous Distributions (Probability Density Functions - PDFs):
      1.Uniform Distribution
      2.Normal Distribution
      3.Lognormal Distribution
      4.Power Law Distribution
      5.Pareto Distribution


### Includes practical Python examples using libraries like scipy.stats.

#### 2. Statistical Tests

1.Z-Test:
   Hypothesis testing for population mean when variance is known.

2.T-Test:
Hypothesis testing for population mean when variance is unknown.
 
3.Chi-Square Test:
Used for categorical data and testing relationships between variables.

4.ANOVA:
Analysis of variance to compare means across multiple groups.

#### Explanation of use cases and Python examples for implementation.
3. Descriptive Statistics

1.Measures of Central Tendency:

Mean, Median, Mode

2.Measures of Spread:

Variance, Standard Deviation, Range

3.Interquartile Range (IQR):

Explanation of detecting outliers using 

lower fence=Q1−1.5×IQR  

upper fence=Q3+1.5×IQR.

4. Inferential Statistics

1.Confidence Intervals
2.Hypothesis Testing
3.p-values and significance levels
